# Smart Contracts

This directory will contain the NEAR smart contracts for the AI Bridge Agent.

## Development

For the alpha version, we're working on these smart contract features:
1. AI Interaction Contract - for persisting AI conversations on-chain
2. AIAgent Registry - for registering and discovering AI agents
3. ZKP Verification - for private AI computation verification

## Usage

To deploy a contract:
1. Compile the contract
2. Deploy using NEAR CLI or the deployment scripts in the `scripts` directory
3. Interact with the contract through the agent interface
